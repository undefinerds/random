#RANDOMNESS
This repo is a safe hold for our files. Anything we code is gonna be here. We hope it could help 
someone else. Especially __university__ classmates.

##What's this for?
Anything.

##Has a License?
No, this is free, public and fun. We push it here to make it usable for others "as is", and we're not 
responsible of any trouble, bug (well yeah, maybe we are responsible for it), or possible break-ups 
for their use.

##Who ever did it?
A bunch of people. Maybe Carlos Ramones, Jhinel Arcaya, Gustavo Velazquez and Geremy DÃ­az are some of 
their authors.

##Can I push one of my own?
Yes! Join and enjoy! Just make a pull request and we'll see your name up.
